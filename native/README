To build from sources you should install gcc, g++, make tools and ncurses library (development version).

Package names are different in different linux distros.

Then use command

    $make
    
If you want to build a fat binaries (dual-exe: for x86 and x86_64 both) add to makefile's CCFLAGS and
LDFLAGS next options:

    -arch i386 -arch x86_64
    
( For MacOS X it is critical, because mono is 32-bit, but built with default settings libtermkey is 64-bit.
You will be confused when DllNotFoundException will thrown. )
